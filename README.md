## üöÄ Project Overview: Solving Time-Debt

TLDL is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) web application designed to solve the critical problem of **time-consuming audio consumption** and **information overload**. It automates the process of transcribing and summarizing long-form audio content to facilitate **immediate knowledge gain**.

## üéØ The Problem & The Informed Professional

The core issue is **efficiency**. Our users are facing **time-debt** when trying to process valuable, long-form content.

* **The Problem:** Researchers and content marketers waste hours manually sifting through audio or long transcripts. They need $\mathbf{90}$ minutes of information delivered in $\mathbf{2}$ minutes.
* **Target User:** The **Informed Professional** (solo entrepreneur, student, or busy researcher). This persona values **efficiency** above all else and demands a **concise, executive-style summary** to inform quick decisions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Progress (MVP)

The application foundation is complete and ready for API integration:

* **Web Framework:** Streamlit (Python) for a simple, single-page UI.
* **Deployment:** The application is live and hosted on **Streamlit Community Cloud**, with Continuous Deployment (CD) linked directly to this GitHub repository.
* **Core Feature (UX):** The app features a File Uploader and a Summary Length Slider, prioritizing a clean, **high-efficiency user experience (UX)**.

## üîÆ Next Steps

The final phase will focus on integrating the powerful processing backbone:

* **Transcription & Summarization:** Integration of the **OpenAI API**. We will use the **Whisper API** for high-accuracy audio transcription and the **GPT API** to generate the final, high-quality, executive summary.
